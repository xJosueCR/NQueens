# NQueens
This in a solution for NQueens algorith developed in Erlang
# Main steps
NQueens is a very popular algorith to practice backtracking, in this opportunity we decided to implement a small solution based on Erlang. We can resume the steps for every genetic algoritm in this next steps: 
- Initialization of population: in this step based on a natural number N given us by the user, we are going to create a population with the form: N * 4. The main idea here is to have 16 individous that are part of that population, each of those individous are gonna have N chromosomens or genes.
